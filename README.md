# USPS
Codes for "Unknown Support Prototype Set for Open Set Recognition". The corresponding paper can be found in \[[link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-025-02384-9)\]. <br>
* **Highlights**：<br><br>1. In contrast with classical prototype-based methods which constructs prototypes for unknown classes, we construct prototypes for unknowns without any available samples.<br><br>2. We construct unknown prototypes in semantic space and then map them to deep feature space.
* **Implimentation**：<br><br>This repository provides a pytorch-version implementation of USUP. The scripts has been tested on CIFAR-10-10. Before running, please put the original CIFAR10 dataset files into /root/data. Here are the commands for runing the scripts:<br><br>1. cd ./backbone<br><br>2. python3 run.py --dataset cifar-10-10 --split_idx 3  --data_root /root/data<br><br>3. cd ..<br><br>4. python3 cgan.py --dataset cifar10 --split 3<br><br>5. python3 usps.py --dataset cifar10 --split 3<br>


* **Notes**：<br><br>Sensitive hyperparameters include: training epoch of cgan, adversarial training round, and epoch per round. If you find overfitting on some datasets, we observed the same issue. To address this, we use early-stop based on the validation set. If you have any problems, feel free to contact me (jiangggss AT tju.edu.cn). Have fun and may it inspire your own idea :-)
